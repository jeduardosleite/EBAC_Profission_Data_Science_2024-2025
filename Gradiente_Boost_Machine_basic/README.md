I answered the following questions:

- Name 5 differences between AdaBoost and GBM;
- Access the Scikit-learn – GBM link, read the explanation (translate if necessary) and create a Jupyter notebook containing the GBM classification and regression example;
- Cite 5 Hyperparameters importantes no GBM;
- Use Grid Search to find the best hyperparameters for the example dataset;
- Accessing the article by [Jerome Friedman (Stochastic)]('https://jerryfriedman.su.domains/ftp/stobst.pdf') and thinking about the name given to Stochastic GBM, what is the biggest difference between the two algorithms.
